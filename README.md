# MetalMusic

The code in this repo is adapted from the tutorial [How to Make Your First Circle Using Metal Shaders](https://betterprogramming.pub/making-your-first-circle-using-metal-shaders-1e5049ec8505 by Alex Barbulescu. 

The tutorial was written in 2019 and was designed for the old UIKit. I adapted it to work with the new SwiftUI 2023.
